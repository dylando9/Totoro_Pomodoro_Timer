## Introduction
Welcome to the Totoro Pomodoro Timer! This is a simple and efficient tool designed to help you manage your time effectively using the Pomodoro Technique. Whether you're a student, professional, or anyone looking to improve productivity, this timer can help you stay focused, reduce distractions, and boost your productivity.

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that encourages working in short, focused bursts (typically 25 minutes) followed by a short break (5 minutes). After completing a set of these cycles, you can take a longer break (usually 15-30 minutes).

## How to Use
To use the Totoro Pomodoro Timer, simply run the code on main.py, press <i>start</i> to begin your session. Once started, the timer will go for 25 minutes followed by a short break, then the cycle continues. Press <i>reset</i> to stop and reset the timer to 00:00.
